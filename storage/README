1.) Create a folder next to this README called nfs-storage with permissions 777
	mkdir nfs-storage
	sudo chmod 777 nfs-storage

2.) Run the container:
	docker compose up

3.) Install NFS dependencies
	sudo apt install nfs-client

OR

Run the included script: ./run.sh
-------------------------------------------

4.)Mount the exposed folder on your machine.
	sudo mount -v <ip_of_container>:/ /path/to/local/mountpoint

# !!NOTE!!
NFS does not allow sharing filesystems on the local machine, this docker container
needs to be run in a VM or seperate machine in order to work.
